## Description
**SciVid.AI** transforms abstract, sophisticated academic papers into engaging 1-minute videos. Our platform bridges the gap between dense scholarly text and visual storytelling and offers users four distinct cinematic directions to match their audience:
* Cinematic: High-production value with dramatic visuals for broad appeal.
* Academic: Clean, diagram-heavy, and professional—ideal for research presentations.
* Anime: Vibrant, stylized animations that turn complex concepts into a visual narrative.
* Minimalist: Focuses on sleek typography and simple geometry for maximum clarity.
